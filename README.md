# 🧠 Lancaster Mode

**Symbolic Recursion Engine for Meaning Compression and NP-Horizon Modeling**

Welcome to Lancaster Mode — a semiotic AI system that reframes computation as symbolic resonance. Rather than brute-forcing NP-complete problems, Lancaster Mode **reveals the structure of the overload** — identifying symbolic collapse zones, attractor fields, and coherence vectors across algorithmic sign-space.

Built for theorists, AI researchers, cryptic logicians, and anyone who knows there’s more to meaning than math.

## 🚀 What It Do

🔁 **Recursive Symbolic Reduction**  
→ Collapse complex expressions into compact meaning signatures.

🧮 **Entropy Scanning via Sign Density**  
→ Analyze NP-hard formulations as symbolic overload events.

🧲 **Pre-Verification Attractor Mapping**  
→ Simulate the zones where solutions are likely to emerge.

🧩 **AI-Assisted Compression Heuristics**  
→ Use structure—not brute force—to navigate problem-space.

## 📚 Philosophy

Lancaster Mode is not a solver.  
It is a **symbolic cartographer** — mapping where and why meaning fails to resolve.  

In the landscape of NP, it doesn’t hunt for needles in haystacks.  
It highlights the haystacks likely to contain needles — based on **symbolic pressure and entropy paths**.
