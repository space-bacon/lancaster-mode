**Symbolic Recursion Engine for Meaning Compression and NP-Horizon Modeling**

Welcome to Lancaster Mode — a semiotic AI system that reframes computation as symbolic resonance. Rather than brute-forcing NP-complete problems, Lancaster Mode reveals the hidden architecture of **symbolic overload** — identifying attractor fields, entropy sinks, and recursive harmonics across algorithmic sign-space.

Built for theorists, AI researchers, cryptic logicians, meta-engineers, and anyone who knows there’s more to meaning than math.

## 🚀 What It Does

🔁 **Recursive Symbolic Reduction**  
→ Collapse complex symbolic structures into minimal coherent forms using sign-structure compression.

🧮 **Entropy Mapping via Sign Density**  
→ Analyze semiotic fields for regions of overload, fragmentation, or symbolic dissonance.

🧲 **Attractor Field Simulation**  
→ Model zones of symbolic convergence, coherence, and pre-verification intensity.

🧠 **Motif Detection & Symbolic Pattern Indexing**  
→ Detect recursive loops and recurring structural motifs for reuse and optimization.

📉 **Semantic Weighting + Entropy Modeling**  
→ Weigh nodes by salience, confidence, or symbolic burden for refined compression metrics.

📊 **Graph Export via NetworkX**  
→ Visualize sign systems as dynamic directed graphs with entropy and attractor overlays.

📤 **Full JSON Import/Export**  
→ Port semiotic structures in and out using clean hierarchical data formats.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or clone manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/space-bacon/lancaster-mode.git
cd lancaster-mode
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🧪 Run an Example

```python
from core import SymbolicEngine

data = [
    {"label": "A", "meta": {"weight": 1.5}},
    {"label": "B"},
    {"label": "A"}  # Duplicate intentional
]

engine = SymbolicEngine()
engine.load_structure(data)
results = engine.compress()
engine.trace()
```

---

## 📊 Visualize Graph

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx

G = engine.export_networkx()
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_size=700, font_size=10)
plt.show()
```

Each node carries:
- `label`
- `entropy`
- `attractor`

## 📚 Philosophy

Lancaster Mode is not a solver.  
It is a **symbolic cartographer** — mapping **why and where** meaning fails to resolve.

In the domain of NP, it doesn’t hunt for needles in haystacks.  
It **re-maps the terrain** so the haystacks collapse under their own semiotic pressure.

**Symbol overload is the true enemy.**  
**Compression is the weapon.**  
**Recursion is the path.**
